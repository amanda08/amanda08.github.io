                <em><p>“Curiosity is the engine of achievement.” - Ken Robinson.
                </p>
                </em>
                <p>The majority of my career so far has focused largely on education technologies in various roles. I have moved from teaching and school leadership, to working among successful global education technology companies in sales, professional learning and support.</p>
                <p>Throughout this time I have always had a passion for technology, particularly as an enabler of diversity, creativity and innovation. From working as part of a team to come up with new, more effective processes, to working with teachers to find ways to use technology to better connect with individual students at a deeper level.</p>
                <p>I reached a point during this time when I was able to stop and fully acknowledge my strong interest in the technical side of these experiences. I have always found myself building websites, databases and various other online environments to increase collaboration. As my curiosity in this area continued to grow, I started learning Java and discovered just how strong my passion for programming was. It was at this point I made the decision to pursue a career in web development.</p>
                <p>Along the way I also dived into learning Ruby, and met some of the wonderful people and companies that support the local Ruby community. My recent experience at Envato has provided me with the exposure I needed to a commercial development setting. I feel I’m now ready to take the leap into a Junior Developer role. Along with my enthusiasm and eagerness to learn, I feel I bring a wealth of additional skills from my previous experiences.</p>
                <p>It’s my objective to continue to engage my passion for learning and technology in ways that enable diversity, creativity and innovation.</p>
