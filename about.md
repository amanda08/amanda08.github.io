Welcome to my blog. My name's Amanda Neumann. I used to be a teacher. I'm also a Mum to a gorgeous princess. In my teaching and leadership career I've always been heavily involved in education technology, teaching teachers how to use technology effectively as well as building websites, intranets, databases and other things along the way. In early 2013 I realised it's never too late and made the decision to get into web development. As for why I've never done this before, that's a story I'm only just beginning to figure out and will write a post about some other time! So I'm learning Ruby, among other things. And loving both the code and the community. 

If you're interested, I created this site using Jekyll and GitHub pages. More info on that [here](/posts/welcome-to-jekyll).
